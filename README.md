# Colab-Crypto-Mining
My Cryptocurrency Mining Experiments on Google CoLab Notebooks

This Repository is under rapid construction. Here, I'll be sharing the more Jupyter Notebooks with scripts for running mining nodes on Google CoLabs. 
Soon, scripts for mining **Dodgecoin, Litecoin, Stellar and whatever possible** will be shared *(After successful experimentation)*.

Here I accept the fact that the Google CoLabs are actually meant to deploy and train Machine Learning and Data Analysis stuffs.
But as someone who advocates for the freedom of knowledge through experimentation, I consider it a worth try for everyone. 
And above all, its not something deployed permenently *(Google CoLabs sessions have a maximum lifespan of 12 hours)*.

**Happy Coding**
